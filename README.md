# Classroom branch B

## Setup

 1. [Setup your Cloud9 workspace as usual.](https://guides.firstdraft.com/starting-on-a-project-in-cloud9)
 1. In a Terminal, run `bin/setup` as usual.
 1. Click Run Project to start the app.
 1. Navigate to the app in Chrome.
 1. Note: as you are working and running into error messages, you may be prompted to run a different `bin/whitelist X.X.X.X` command each time your IP address/location changes; copy-paste it into a Terminal prompt if so in order to get much more helpful error messages, including an interactive console where you can poke at your variables to see what's going wrong.
 1. Check your progress/submit your work with `rails grade` as usual.

> If at any point `rspec` fails with the message "Migrations are pending. To resolve this issue, run: bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test" then run
>
> `rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test`

## Introduction

You'll start with an almost blank application that just has a navbar with links corresponding to each necessary resource.

This application has 2 database tables:

 - students (columns: first_name, last_name, email)
 - courses (columns: name)

Each resource needs 7 "golden" actions to allow users to interact with it:

### CREATE

 - new_form
 - create_row

### READ

 - index
 - show

### UPDATE

 - edit_form
 - update_row

### DELETE

 - destroy

Build the Golden Seven for Students and Courses from scratch, the same way that you did for Photogram Golden 7. Hint: [the README for Photogram Golden 7](https://github.com/appdev-projects/photogram-golden-7#photogram-golden-seven) will come in handy.

### [Here is your target.](https://classroom-target.herokuapp.com/)

Make yours work like it. Your local app is using a light theme, and the reference app is using a dark theme so that you don't get confused between tabs as you try to check your work.

If you run into any problems or error messages, **use the server log to help figure out what's going on.**

I've already generated both database tables and models for you, so you just have to do build the interface for users to CRUD records. All in all, you need to:

 - Build the Golden Seven for Students from scratch.
 - Build the Golden Seven for Courses from scratch.

Some tools that you've got:

 - You can use the `rails console`.
 - You can navigate to `/admin` to see the admin dashboard; sign in with username: `admin@example.com` and password: `password`.
 - When you ran `bin/setup`, it included a script to pre-populate both tables with some dummy data for you. You can see what's there using either `rails console` or the admin dashboard.

Again, [the README for Photogram Golden 7](https://github.com/appdev-projects/photogram-golden-7#photogram-golden-seven) will be a good guide to follow; the Golden 7 are pretty formulaic.
